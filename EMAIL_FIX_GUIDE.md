# Email Verification Fix Guide

## Issues Found

1. **RESEND_API_KEY is not set** - This is required for emails to work
2. **Gmail address won't work** - Resend doesn't allow Gmail addresses as FROM_EMAIL
3. **No error logging** - Errors were failing silently

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Set Up Resend API Key

1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### 2. Add to `.env` File

Add these lines to your `.env` file:

```env
# Resend Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@info.payollar.com
RESEND_SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@info.payollar.com
```

**Important Notes:**
- Using `info.payollar.com` as the verified domain in Resend
- For **development**: You can use `onboarding@resend.dev` if you want to test without domain verification
- For **production**: Use `noreply@info.payollar.com` and `support@info.payollar.com`

### 3. Restart Your Server

After adding the environment variables, restart your development server:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Test Email Sending

1. Sign up a new account
2. Check your server logs - you should see:
   - `📧 Attempting to send verification email to: [email]`
   - `✅ Verification email sent successfully: [id]`
3. Check your email inbox for the verification email

## Troubleshooting

### If emails still don't send:

1. **Check server logs** for error messages
2. **Verify RESEND_API_KEY** is correct in `.env`
3. **Check Resend Dashboard** for error logs
4. **Verify FROM_EMAIL** is using:
   - `onboarding@resend.dev` for development
   - Your verified domain for production

### Common Errors:

- **"Email configuration error"** → Check FROM_EMAIL is using Resend test domain or verified domain
- **"Email service is not configured"** → RESEND_API_KEY is missing
- **"Invalid API key"** → Check your API key is correct

## Production Setup

For production, you need to:

1. **Verify your domain** in Resend:
   - Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
   - Add your domain (e.g., `payollar.com`)
   - Add the DNS records they provide
   - Wait for verification

2. **Update environment variables**:
   ```env
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@info.payollar.com
   RESEND_SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@info.payollar.com
   ```

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Added comprehensive error logging
2. ✅ Changed default FROM_EMAIL to Resend test domain
3. ✅ Added user notification about checking email
4. ✅ Added API key validation
5. ✅ Better error messages for debugging
